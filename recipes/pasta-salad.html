        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple recipe combines pasta, veggies and cheese with a tangy dressing that makes the dish impossible to resist.</p>
        <p>Pasta salad is typically served as a side dish, especially at potlucks and picnics. Since this pasta salad dressing is oil-based, it'll keep a little longer than its dairy-based counterparts. Store pasta salad with dressing in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. It's best served cold, so you won't need to reheat it â€” just take it straight out of the fridge and enjoy!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
