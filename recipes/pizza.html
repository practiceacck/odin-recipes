        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A classic crowd-pleaser and a fun hobbyist challenge or family activity in making this common takeout dish at home.</p>
        <p>The pizza dough recipe makes enough dough for two 10 to 12-inch pizzas. Bread flour is the best flour for homemade pizza dough. You can use all-purpose flour instead of the bread flour called for in the recipe, but bread flour is higher in gluten than all-purpose flour and will make a crispier crust for your pizza.</p>
        <p>There are some toppings that should be cooked first before topping a pizza because they won’t cook fully before the pizza is done cooking. Raw meat should be fully cooked before adding it as a topping. Any vegetables that you don’t want to be raw on the cooked pizza such as onions, peppers, broccoli, or mushrooms, should be sautéed first.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>For the pizza dough</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
            <l1>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</l1>
            <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>For making the pizza</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Cornmeal (to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone)</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce (smooth or pureed)</li>
            <li>Firm mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Fresh soft mozzarella cheese, separated into small clumps</li>
            <li>Bell peppers, stems and seeds removed, very thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Fresh basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>Making the dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment. Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours. For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours). The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Making the pizza</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour.</li>
            <li>Form 2 round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic, and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).</li>
            <li>Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface. Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further. Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches.</li>
            <li>Spoon on the olive oil and tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place the bell peppers and basil or your desired toppings on the pizza.</li>
            <li>Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
